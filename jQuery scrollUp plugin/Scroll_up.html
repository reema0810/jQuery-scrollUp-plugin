    <p id="myParagraph" style="color: hsl(44, 65%, 57%);">The state of the education system has moved to greater heights
        as compared to that in the past centuries. The 21st Century has presented to us an education system that is
        technology driven in which ideas and innovations have outperformed both machine and muscle. That is to say,
        there is a lot that we can now achieve with technology that we could not even dream about in the past. To
        address the low level of literacy, economic matters and other workforce needs, technology has helped a great
        deal ensuring that no child is left behind. This research paper will highlight those areas in education that
        technological advancement has help boost, more particularly it will zero in on the concept of computing and the
        internet.
        Computer and internet technology has completely brought a new trend in the global education that makes it
        possible for people to learn from the comfort of their homes, thanks to the online professional development
        courses. The internet has led to an unprecedented degree of educational content to a wide audience of students
        and tutors alike. And as they leave colleges into the workforce, students do so with a better understanding of
        how they can apply technology in their respective jobs in addition to what they covered in the usual curriculum
        (James L. Morrison, 1998, 2-4).

        It is therefore an open secret that technology has enabled tutors as well as students to explore, develop and
        expand their technical skills through interacting with others in the field all over the globe. Online
        coordination has broken all the education barriers that used to hinder learning, the students are now enjoying a
        wide range of ideas and contextual varieties. With he employment of the new technology, teachers have been able
        to get good tools that that can help them design and deliver lessons that give a reflection of the 21st Century
        to motivate students and inspire their creativity. Every step to integrate technology applications in the
        education system has proved worthwhile in defining a new dimension of education reforms. To be precise,
        Computing has contributed greatly to peoples enrichment and enhancement, thus transforming their lives for the
        better. This does not only occur in the education field, but also in the areas of entertainment, business and
        communication…in a few years time we will be in what can be dubbed “the digital decade” [for luck of a better
        word]. The major challenge in using technology in education is on how to customize it in such a way that it
        would be effective in helping everyone realize their full potential, from a preschooler to a life long learner.
        The presence of technology enhances the level of education and makes it easier. Today the easy access to the
        internet has made education easy. It has increased the level, nowadays students don’t have to wait for the
        teacher to complete a topic, and they can easily read whatever they need online or with the help of different
        educational apps and platforms.
        Nowadays computers and laptops or mobile phones are easily available to educate yourself.
        The use of technology in education is a boon for those who don’t have much time, especially those who work.
        Suppose you work and want to learn a new skill to improve or upgrade your work, so you can easily prefer an
        online course.
        In the COVID-19 epidemic, the schools were closed for more than 6 months and education was only possible online.
        Technology saved students from being uneducated for a year, really thanks to the technology that education
        during COVID got possible.
        There are smart classes available everywhere which increases the interest of students and encourages them to
        read.
        I have seen the difference, how technology has changed modern education. In older days students use to read from
        their books and if they faced any problem, they use to ask their teachers. But it is not necessary that every
        student has the same IQ to understand what the teacher said. Some students won’t get it but they never ask
        because they feel shy.
        But in today’s era when technology is a part of education, students easily get multiple options to solve their
        question. There are multiple platforms where they can also ask a question or can have a live interaction with
        their teachers. Really education has progressed a lot. You can also compare the marks, in the old days people
        use to hardly get distinction but nowadays it is not a big deal.
        Technology has changed the way we impart education. It has made it possible for us to reach out to more
        students, and it has also made it possible for us to deliver the same lessons in a much more efficient manner.
        We can now teach our lessons online, meaning we don’t have to travel all over the place to teach them. We can
        also use technology like video conferencing and chat rooms with our students, which means that we don’t have to
        spend time getting to know them and making sure they understand what we’re teaching them. This has made a
        massive difference in how teachers interact with their students. Before technology, teachers had to spend hours
        preparing for lessons, but they didn’t have the option of using technology when they taught them. Nowadays,
        students get better grades because they are more prepared than ever. Technology has made it possible for us to
        find information from anywhere in the world and share it with others without having to meet them face-to-face
        physically. This means that students can take their education wherever they go, from their bedrooms to their
        classrooms to their offices at work. The internet has made learning possible for everyone, no matter where they
        live or in their country. With the advent of online learning platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and Khan Academy,
        students are no longer limited to traditional classrooms. They can learn at their own pace and access any
        educational content they want.
        Education has always been a stepping stone to success. Education helps us grow and learn new things, but it is
        not enough. To make sure that you are on the right path for your future, it is essential to have a good
        education.
        Technology has proven beneficial and transformation in educational settings in particular. Technology is
        reshaping the world of education from online colleges to digital certificate programs and hybrid set-ups. This
        can help students get their qualifications faster while providing them with more resources needed to succeed.
        Technology has also changed how we learn and teach students today. Technology offers us many ways of teaching
        students online or even in person; there are more options than ever before! There are even digital certificates
        available online, allowing students to get their qualifications quickly without having to travel all over town
        whenever they need something new added to their resume. The importance of technology can be understated when it
        comes to learning because it allows us all access to information from anywhere at any time! This means we do not
        have barriers to getting what we need when it comes time for school or work. Technology allows us all access.
        The most important thing to remember when considering technology’s role in education is that it shouldn’t be
        used as a replacement for human interaction. Instead, Teachers should use it to enhance student learning by
        providing them with opportunities to use their minds outside of the classroom setting. Students can achieve this
        through online courses that allow students across the globe to interact with each other and instructors
        face-to-face or via video conference calls. In addition, virtual reality technology will enable students to
        learn within an immersive environment, which helps them better retain information when it comes time for them to
        apply it later on in life.”
        Most students don’t like to go to school if they feel like wasting their time. When technology is allowed in the
        classroom, teachers can let kids work at a pace that suits them the best without disturbing others.
        This way, students can work independently and get the right amount of help from teachers when needed. Students
        also have an opportunity to do other things like watching movies or playing games while being able to work on
        their assignments.
        Not only does it help with motivation, but it also helps with retention because students can learn more while
        doing something they enjoy doing instead of sitting in a dull classroom day after day without any distractions
        from outside sources such as television or
        Other activities may be distracting from learning purposes. If students feel like wasting their time, they will
        lose interest in school. But when technology is allowed in the classroom, teachers can let kids work at a pace
        that suits them best without disturbing others. Studies show that kids who use electronic devices in class tend
        to perform better than those who do not use such devices. This is because using electronic devices allows them
        to focus on what they are doing instead of being distracted by other things around them.
        There are so many ways that technology in the classroom encourages more communication between teachers and
        parents.
        First, when there is technology in the classroom, there are more opportunities for parents and teachers to
        connect. This can be done through texting and emailing or using social media. It can also be done by video
        chatting. For example, if your child has an after-school homework club, you can text them about their progress
        during class time and ensure they’re completing their work on time.
        Second, it helps children stay connected with their parents. If a student doesn’t have access to technology at
        home, then they may not feel comfortable talking about their day over dinner or on the phone. However, if there
        is a way for them to speak with their parents through a computer or smartphone app, then they will feel more
        encouraged to use it!
        Third, it helps teachers stay connected with parents too! If there’s an easy way for us as educators to
        communicate with our students’ families, then we can work on projects and plan lessons together without having
        face-to-face time. In addition, if online resources are available for students, it will save teachers from
        having to come up with new ways of teaching every time they want something new taught or learned.
        Technology has been used to collect behavioral data on students for years. It’s a great way to get the
        information you need to help your students succeed, but it can also be a little scary if you’re not sure exactly
        how much information is being collected.
        The various apps, software choices, and technological platforms collect student data that can show attendance
        patterns, learning issues in specific subjects, and how they react in particular situations. This allows
        teachers to identify problems early on and work with them before they become too complex to fix. For example, a
        new app called “My School” uses real-time data to inform teachers of students’ attendance rates during class and
        their progress towards completing homework assignments. This information allows teachers to give individualized
        attention to each student based on their needs and wants.
        Teachers can use this information to provide individualized instruction and interventions for students who need
        it most.
        Whether technology is in the classroom or at home, there is the issue of affordability to worry about in today’s
        world. Some households cannot afford to purchase computers for their kids to manage school work. School
        districts don’t have enough money to pay their salaries yearly, much less add new tech components for learning.
        Other expenses can make technology unaffordable for some families: repairs, software updates, and utilities
        (such as electricity). When we focus on having technology in the classroom, we place those at the lowest end of
        the wage scale at a significant disadvantage. With less money, they have less access to lessons and can’t afford
        to purchase devices. Students with greater access can learn more and access lessons more often.
        Technology cannot replace the human touch in imparting education. It, however, plays a paramount role in
        improving efficiency. Students’ character gets affected when they spend too much time on computers and bright
        devices. Instead of making them tech-savvy, it makes them less practical and more imaginative. The transition
        from traditional teaching methods to technology for teaching has a remarkable impact on the student. As a
        result, their level of awareness increased, and the student picked up things quickly and multiplied their
        knowledge instantly. But some challenges need to be met regarding the use of technology in education by the
        students. The challenges are innovation, maintenance, and reliable infrastructure to support the advanced
        technology used in the learning process.
        The state of the education system has moved to greater heights as compared to that in the past centuries. The
        21st Century has presented to us an education system that is technology driven in which ideas and innovations
        have outperformed both machine and muscle. That is to say, there is a lot that we can now achieve with

        they use to ask their teachers. But it is not necessary that every student has the same IQ to understand what
        the teacher said. Some students won’t get it but they never ask because they feel shy. But in today’s era when
        technology is a part of education, students easily get multiple options to solve their question. There are
        multiple platforms where they can also ask a question or can have a live interaction with their teachers. Really
        education has progressed a lot. You can also compare the marks, in the old days people use to hardly get
        distinction but nowadays it is not a big deal. Technology has changed the way we impart education. It has made
        it possible for us to reach out to more students, and it has also made it possible for us to deliver the same
        lessons in a much more efficient manner. We can now teach our lessons online, meaning we don’t have to travel
        all over the place to teach them. We can also use technology like video conferencing and chat rooms with our
        students, which means that we don’t have to spend time getting to know them and making sure they understand what
        we’re teaching them. This has made a massive difference in how teachers interact with their students. Before
        technology, teachers had to spend hours preparing for lessons, but they didn’t have the option of using
        technology when they taught them. Nowadays, students get better grades because they are more prepared than ever.
        Technology has made it possible for us to find information from anywhere in the world and share it with others
        without having to meet them face-to-face physically. This means that students can take their education wherever
        they go, from their bedrooms to their classrooms to their offices at work. The internet has made learning
        possible for everyone, no matter where they live or in their country. With the advent of online learning
        platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and Khan Academy, students are no longer limited to traditional classrooms. They
        can learn at their own pace and access any educational content they want. Education has always been a stepping
        stone to success. Education helps us grow and learn new things, but it is not enough. To make sure that you are
        on the right path for your future, it is essential to have a good education. Technology has proven beneficial
        and transformation in educational settings in particular. Technology is reshaping the world of education from
        online colleges to digital certificate programs and hybrid set-ups. This can help students get their
        qualifications faster while providing them with more resources needed to succeed. Technology has also changed
        how we learn and teach students today. Technology offers us many ways of teaching students online or even in
        person; there are more options than ever before! There are even digital certificates available online, allowing
        students to get their qualifications quickly without having to travel all over town whenever they need something
        new added to their resume. The importance of technology can be understated when it comes to learning because it
        allows us all access to information from anywhere at any time! This means we do not have barriers to getting
        what we need when it comes time for school or work. Technology allows us all access. The most important thing to
        remember when considering technology’s role in education is that it shouldn’t be used as a replacement for human
        interaction. Instead, Teachers should use it to enhance student learning by providing them with opportunities to
        use their minds outside of the classroom setting. Students can achieve this through online courses that allow
        students across the globe to interact with each other and instructors face-to-face or via video conference
        calls. In addition, virtual reality technology will enable students to learn within an immersive environment,
        which helps them better retain information when it comes time for them to apply it later on in life.” Most
        students don’t like to go to school if they feel like wasting their time. When technology is allowed in the
        classroom, teachers can let kids work at a pace that suits them the best without disturbing others. This way,
        students can work independently and get the right amount of help from teachers when needed. Students also have
        an opportunity to do other things like watching movies or playing games while being able to work on their
        assignments. Not only does it help with motivation, but it also helps with retention because students can learn
        more while doing something they enjoy doing instead of sitting in a dull classroom day after day without any
        distractions from outside sources such as television or Other activities may be distracting from learning
        purposes. If students feel like wasting their time, they will lose interest in school. But when technology is
        allowed in the classroom, teachers can let kids work at a pace that suits them best without disturbing others.
        Studies show that kids who use electronic devices in class tend to perform better than those who do not use such
        devices. This is because using electronic devices allows them to focus on what they are doing instead of being
        distracted by other things around them. There are so many ways that technology in the classroom encourages more
        communication between teachers and parents. First, when there is technology in the classroom, there are more
        opportunities for parents and teachers to connect. This can be done through texting and emailing or using social
        media. It can also be done by video chatting. For example, if your child has an after-school homework club, you
        can text them about their progress during class time and ensure they’re completing their work on time. Second,
        it helps children stay connected with their parents. If a student doesn’t have access to technology at home,
        then they may not feel comfortable talking about their day over dinner or on the phone. However, if there is a
        way for them to speak with their parents through a computer or smartphone app, then they will feel more
        encouraged to use it! Third, it helps teachers stay connected with parents too! If there’s an easy way for us as
        educators to communicate with our students’ families, then we can work on projects and plan lessons together
        without having face-to-face time. In addition, if online resources are available for students, it will save
        teachers from having to come up with new ways of teaching every time they want something new taught or learned.
        Technology has been used to collect behavioral data on students for years. It’s a great way to get the
        information you need to help your students succeed, but it can also be a little scary if you’re not sure exactly
        how much information is being collected. The various apps, software choices, and technological platforms collect
        student data that can show attendance patterns, learning issues in specific subjects, and how they react in
        particular situations. This allows teachers to identify problems early on and work with them before they become
        too complex to fix. For example, a new app called “My School” uses real-time data to inform teachers of
        students’ attendance rates during class and their progress towards completing homework assignments. This
        information allows teachers to give individualized attention to each student based on their needs and wants.
        Teachers can use this information to provide individualized instruction and interventions for students who need
        it most. Whether technology is in the classroom or at home, there is the issue of affordability to worry about
        in today’s world. Some households cannot afford to purchase computers for their kids to manage school work.
        School districts don’t have enough money to pay their salaries yearly, much less add new tech components for
        learning. Other expenses can make technology unaffordable for some families: repairs, software updates, and
        utilities (such as electricity). When we focus on having technology in the classroom, we place those at the
        lowest end of the wage scale at a significant disadvantage. With less money, they have less access to lessons
        and can’t afford to purchase devices. Students with greater access can learn more and access lessons more often.
        Technology cannot replace the human touch in imparting education. It, however, plays a paramount role in
        improving efficiency. Students’ character gets affected when they spend too much time on computers and bright
        devices. Instead of making them tech-savvy, it makes them less practical and more imaginative. The transition
        from traditional teaching methods to technology for teaching has a remarkable impact on the student. As a
        result, their level of awareness increased, and the student picked up things quickly and multiplied their
        knowledge instantly. But some challenges need to be met regarding the use of technology in education by the
        students. The challenges are innovation, maintenance, and reliable infrastructure to support the advanced
        technology used in the learning process.

        resources are available for students, it will save teachers from having to come up with new ways of teaching
